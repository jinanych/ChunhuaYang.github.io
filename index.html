                        <p>Currently, my research focuses on the understanding of code changes. Since 2016, I've been working on the understanding of the relationships among changes that are committed together. So far I have proposed an approach to improving the efficiency of tree-differencing tools by pruning the AST with hunks, and

                        <p>From 1999 to 2014, I was insterested in the field of aspect-oriented software development, and I proposed an approach to weaving stateful aspects into software architecture, as well as methods to analyze and reason out the influences of aspect weaving.</p> 
                        <p>Before 1999 I was also interested in the field of natural language processing, and I implemented a word-segment approach for written Chinese.</p>
